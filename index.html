        <p> Bora Bora is considered to be one of the most beautiful places on the planet. The “Pearl of the Pacific,” as it is known, is an island paradise, with a crystal clear lagoon, superb coral reefs, vast stretches of white sandy beach and luxuriant forests of lush green tropical vegetation. It’s hardly surprising that people all over the world dream of visiting Bora Bora at least once in their life. </p>

        <p class="stylerule1">Though it may not initially seem like a foodie’s paradise, Bora Bora offers a variety of culinary options, allowing diners to find one that’s just right for them. Savour the local favourite, poisson cru, which is a type of tuna marinated in coconut and lime, almost like a Polynesian ceviche. Or try saumon des dieux also known as the ‘Salmon of the Gods’; one bite into this usually grilled fish (which tastes and feels something like a mix between tuna and salmon) will make the rationale behind its name immediately apparent. </p>

    <p> During your visit to Bora Bora, don’t be surprised if you feel a strange sensation at times. This is the Mana, the spiritual force at the center of Polynesian beliefs. It is another Tahitian word, along with tattoo, that has entered the English language. Mana is a concept that isn’t easy to understand, but is an inner strength which links all living beings to their past. It is a physical, mental and emotional force that binds Tahitians to their cultural identity. </p>

        <p class="styleRule1">Magical vacation

A vacation on the island of Bora Bora is a dream that everybody should fulfill at least once in their life. The breathtakingly beautiful lagoon and the warmth of the local population will make it a truly unforgettable occasion. But be warned: once you’ve fulfilled your dream, you’ll almost certainly dream of coming back"</p>
